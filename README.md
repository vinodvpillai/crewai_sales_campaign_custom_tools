### 1. `crew.py`
Defines the `CrewaiSalesCampaignCustomToolsCrew` class, integrating various CrewAI tools and defining agents and tasks:
- **Agents**:
  - `sales_rep_agent`: Identifies high-value leads.
  - `lead_sales_rep_agent`: Crafts personalized, engaging communications for outreach.
- **Tasks**:
  - `lead_profiling_task`: Compiles a detailed lead profile.
  - `personalized_outreach_task`: Develops a personalized outreach strategy with email drafts.

### 2. `main.py`
The entry point to run and test the application locally, with functions to:
- **Run**: Execute the crew's processes with example inputs.
- **Train**: Simulate training for the agents with specified iterations.
- **Replay**: Replay a task from a specific checkpoint.
- **Test**: Test crew execution and review results.

### 3. Configuration Files
- **`tasks.yaml`**: Contains the configuration for tasks including descriptions, expected outputs, and agent assignments.
- **`agents.yaml`**: Defines the agents, their roles, goals, and backstories for more realistic task execution.


## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <=3.13 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```

> **Note**: Make sure to include `CrewAI` and any other required libraries in `requirements.txt`.

### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

## How to Use

1. **Setup Configuration**:
   - Customize `agents.yaml` to define agent roles, goals, and backgrounds.
   - Update `tasks.yaml` for specifying task descriptions, tools, and expected outputs.

2. **Run the Application**:
   To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

3. **Review the Output**:
   The generated report will be displayed in the console or saved to a specified output file as defined in the `crew.py` logic.
   This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Project Overview

This application leverages **CrewAI's** capabilities for coordinating agents with distinct goals and tasks to generate reports efficiently. Each component plays a critical role:

- **Configurable Agents**: Modify agent characteristics and roles as needed.
- **Flexible Task Descriptions**: Adjust task specifics for different report types.
- **Simple Integration**: Use `main.py` to easily pass queries and trigger the workflow.
- **Scalable Logic**: Expandable to include more agents and complex tasks as your use case grows.
